    Ideal in an Infinite Polynomial Ring, invariant under permutation of
    variable indices.

    THEORY:

    An Infinite Polynomial Ring with finitely many generators `x_\\ast,
    y_\\ast, ...` over a field `F` is a free commutative `F`-algebra
    generated by infinitely many 'variables' `x_0, x_1, x_2,..., y_0,
    y_1, y_2,...`. We refer to the natural number `n` as the *index*
    of the variable `x_n`. See more detailed description at
    :mod:`~sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_ring`


    Infinite Polynomial Rings are equipped with a permutation action
    by permuting positive variable indices, i.e., `x_n^P = x_{P(n)},
    y_n^P=y_{P(n)}, ...` for any permutation `P`.  Note that the
    variables `x_0, y_0, ...` of index zero are invariant under that
    action.

    A *Symmetric Ideal* is an ideal in an infinite polynomial ring `X`
    that is invariant under the permutation action. In other words, if
    `\\mathfrak S_\\infty` denotes the symmetric group of `1,2,...`,
    then a Symmetric Ideal is a right `X[\\mathfrak
    S_\\infty]`-submodule of `X`.

    It is known by work of Aschenbrenner and Hillar [AB2007]_ that an
    Infinite Polynomial Ring `X` with a single generator `x_\\ast` is
    Noetherian, in the sense that any Symmetric Ideal `I\\subset X` is
    finitely generated modulo addition, multiplication by elements of
    `X`, and permutation of variable indices (hence, it is a finitely
    generated right `X[\\mathfrak S_\\infty]`-module).

    Moreover, if `X` is equipped with a lexicographic monomial
    ordering with `x_1 < x_2 < x_3 ...` then there is an algorithm of
    Buchberger type that computes a Groebner basis `G` for `I` that
    allows for computation of a unique normal form, that is zero
    precisely for the elements of `I` -- see [AB2008]_. See
    :meth:`groebner_basis` for more details.

    Our implementation allows more than one generator and also
    provides degree lexicographic and degree reverse lexicographic
    monomial orderings -- we do, however, not guarantee termination of
    the Buchberger algorithm in these cases.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: X.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
        sage: I = [x[1]*y[2]*y[1] + 2*x[1]*y[2]] * X
        sage: I == loads(dumps(I))
        True
        sage: latex(I)
        \\left(x_{1} y_{2} y_{1} + 2 x_{1} y_{2}\\right)\\Bold{Q}[x_{\\ast}, y_{\\ast}][\\mathfrak{S}_{\\infty}]

    The default ordering is lexicographic. We now compute a Groebner basis::

        sage: J = I.groebner_basis(); J   # about 3 seconds                             # needs sage.combinat
        [x_2*x_1*y_2 - x_2*x_1*y_1, x_1*y_2*y_1 + 2*x_1*y_2,
         x_2*y_2*y_1 + 2*x_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_1^2 + 2*x_2*x_1*y_1]

    Note that even though the symmetric ideal can be generated by a
    single polynomial, its reduced symmetric Groebner basis comprises
    four elements.  Ideal membership in ``I`` can now be tested by
    commuting symmetric reduction modulo ``J``::

        sage: I.reduce(J)                                                               # needs sage.combinat
        Symmetric Ideal (0) of Infinite polynomial ring in x, y over Rational Field

    The Groebner basis is not point-wise invariant under permutation::

        sage: # needs sage.combinat
        sage: P = Permutation([2, 1])
        sage: J[2]
        x_2*y_2*y_1 + 2*x_2*y_1
        sage: J[2]^P
        x_1*y_2*y_1 + 2*x_1*y_2
        sage: J[2]^P in J
        True

    However, any element of ``J`` has symmetric reduction zero even
    after applying a permutation. This even holds when the
    permutations involve higher variable indices than the ones
    occurring in ``J``::

        sage: [[(p^P).reduce(J) for p in J] for P in Permutations(3)]                   # needs sage.combinat
        [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

    Since ``I`` is not a Groebner basis, it is no surprise that it cannot detect
    ideal membership::

        sage: [p.reduce(I) for p in J]                                                  # needs sage.combinat
        [x_2*x_1*y_2 - x_2*x_1*y_1, 0, x_2*y_2*y_1 + 2*x_2*y_1, x_2*x_1*y_1^2 + 2*x_2*x_1*y_1]

    Note that we give no guarantee that the computation of a symmetric
    Groebner basis will terminate in any order different from
    lexicographic.

    When multiplying Symmetric Ideals or raising them to some integer
    power, the permutation action is taken into account, so that the
    product is indeed the product of ideals in the mathematical sense.

        a field, since symmetric Groebner bases are not implemented in
        this setting.

        THEORY:

        Reduction of an element `p` of an Infinite Polynomial Ring `X`
        by some other element `q` means the following:

        1. Let `M` and `N` be the leading terms of `p` and `q`.
        2. Test whether there is a permutation `P` that does not does
           not diminish the variable indices occurring in `N` and
           preserves their order, so that there is some term `T\\in X`
           with `T N^P = M`. If there is no such permutation, return `p`
        3. Replace `p` by `p - T q^P` and continue with step 1.

        EXAMPLES::

             Infinite polynomial ring in x, y over Rational Field

        The preceding is correct, since any permutation that turns
        ``x[1]^2*y[2]`` into a factor of ``x[3]^2*y[2]`` interchanges
        the variable indices 1 and 2 -- which is not allowed. However,
        reduction by ``x[2]^2*y[1]`` works, since one can change
        variable index 1 into 2 and 2 into 3::

            sage: I.reduce([x[2]^2*y[1]])                                               # needs sage.combinat

        INPUT:

        - ``tailreduce`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, use tail reduction

          :meth:`symmetrisation` for more details.

        The computation of symmetric Groebner bases also involves the
        computation of *classical* Groebner bases, i.e., of Groebner
        bases for ideals in polynomial rings with finitely many
        variables. For these computations, Sage provides the following
        ALGORITHMS:

        ''
            autoselect (default)

        'singular:groebner'
            Singular's ``groebner`` command

        'singular:std'
            Singular's ``std`` command

        'singular:stdhilb'
            Singular's ``stdhib`` command

        'singular:stdfglm'
            Singular's ``stdfglm`` command

        'singular:slimgb'
            Singular's ``slimgb`` command

        'libsingular:std'
            libSingular's ``std`` command

        'libsingular:slimgb'
            libSingular's ``slimgb`` command

        'toy:buchberger'
            Sage's toy/educational buchberger without strategy

        'toy:buchberger2'
            Sage's toy/educational buchberger with strategy

        'toy:d_basis'
            Sage's toy/educational d_basis algorithm

        'macaulay2:gb'
            Macaulay2's ``gb`` command (if available)

        'magma:GroebnerBasis'
            Magma's ``Groebnerbasis`` command (if available)


        If only a system is given - e.g. 'magma' - the default algorithm is
        chosen for that system.

        .. NOTE::

           The Singular and libSingular versions of the respective
           algorithms are identical, but the former calls an external
           Singular process while the later calls a C function, i.e. the
           calling overhead is smaller.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: X.<x,y> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
            sage: I1 = X * (x[1] + x[2], x[1]*x[2])
            sage: I1.groebner_basis()                                                   # needs sage.combinat
            [x_1]
            sage: I2 = X * (y[1]^2*y[3] + y[1]*x[3])
            sage: I2.groebner_basis()                                                   # needs sage.combinat
            [x_1*y_2 + y_2^2*y_1, x_2*y_1 + y_2*y_1^2]

        Note that a symmetric Groebner basis of a principal ideal is
        not necessarily formed by a single polynomial.

        When using the algorithm originally suggested by Aschenbrenner
        and Hillar, the result is the same, but the computation takes
        much longer::

            sage: I2.groebner_basis(use_full_group=True)                                # needs sage.combinat
            [x_1*y_2 + y_2^2*y_1, x_2*y_1 + y_2*y_1^2]

        Last, we demonstrate how the report on the progress of
        computations looks like::

            sage: I1.groebner_basis(report=True, reduced=True)                          # needs sage.combinat

        The Aschenbrenner-Hillar algorithm is only guaranteed to work
        if the base ring is a field. So, we raise a :exc:`TypeError` if this
        is not the case::
