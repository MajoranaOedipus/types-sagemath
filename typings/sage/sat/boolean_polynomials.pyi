    '''
    Solve system of Boolean polynomials ``F`` by solving the
    SAT-problem -- produced by ``converter`` -- using ``solver``.

    INPUT:

    - ``F`` -- a sequence of Boolean polynomials

    - ``n`` -- number of solutions to return. If ``n`` is +infinity
      then all solutions are returned. If ``n <infinity`` then ``n``
      solutions are returned if ``F`` has at least ``n``
      solutions. Otherwise, all solutions of ``F`` are
      returned. (default: ``1``)

    - ``converter`` -- an ANF to CNF converter class or object.  If
      ``converter`` is ``None`` then
      :class:`sage.sat.converters.polybori.CNFEncoder` is used to
      construct a new converter. (default: ``None``)

    - ``solver`` -- a SAT-solver class or object. If ``solver`` is
      ``None`` then :class:`sage.sat.solvers.cryptominisat.CryptoMiniSat`
      is used to construct a new converter.  (default: ``None``)

    - ``target_variables`` -- list of variables. The elements of the list are
      used to exclude a particular combination of variable assignments of a
      solution from any further solution. Furthermore ``target_variables``
      denotes which variable-value pairs appear in the solutions. If
      ``target_variables`` is ``None`` all variables appearing in the
      polynomials of ``F`` are used to construct exclusion clauses.
      (default: ``None``)

    - ``**kwds`` -- parameters can be passed to the converter and the
      solver by prefixing them with ``c_`` and ``s_`` respectively. For
      example, to increase CryptoMiniSat\'s verbosity level, pass
      ``s_verbosity=1``.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of dictionaries, each of which contains a variable assignment
    solving ``F``.

    EXAMPLES:

    We construct a very small-scale AES system of equations::

        sage: sr = mq.SR(1, 1, 1, 4, gf2=True, polybori=True)
        sage: while True:  # workaround (see :issue:`31891`)
        ....:     try:
        ....:         F, s = sr.polynomial_system()
        ....:         break
        ....:     except ZeroDivisionError:
        ....:         pass

    and pass it to a SAT solver::

        sage: from sage.sat.boolean_polynomials import solve as solve_sat
        sage: s = solve_sat(F)
        sage: F.subs(s[0])
        Polynomial Sequence with 36 Polynomials in 0 Variables

    This time we pass a few options through to the converter and the solver::

        sage: s = solve_sat(F, c_max_vars_sparse=4, c_cutting_number=8)
        sage: F.subs(s[0])
        Polynomial Sequence with 36 Polynomials in 0 Variables

    We construct a very simple system with three solutions
    and ask for a specific number of solutions::

        sage: B.<a,b> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
        sage: f = a*b
        sage: l = solve_sat([f],n=1)
        sage: len(l) == 1, f.subs(l[0])
        (True, 0)

        sage: l = solve_sat([a*b],n=2)
        sage: len(l) == 2, f.subs(l[0]), f.subs(l[1])
        (True, 0, 0)

        sage: sorted((d[a], d[b]) for d in solve_sat([a*b], n=3))
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
        sage: sorted((d[a], d[b]) for d in solve_sat([a*b], n=4))
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]
        sage: sorted((d[a], d[b]) for d in solve_sat([a*b], n=infinity))
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]

    In the next example we see how the ``target_variables`` parameter works::

        sage: from sage.sat.boolean_polynomials import solve as solve_sat
        sage: R.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
        sage: F = [a + b, a + c + d]

    First the normal use case::

        sage: sorted((D[a], D[b], D[c], D[d])
        ....:        for D in solve_sat(F, n=infinity))
        [(0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1, 0)]

    Now we are only interested in the solutions of the variables a and b::

        sage: solve_sat(F, n=infinity, target_variables=[a,b])
        [{b: 0, a: 0}, {b: 1, a: 1}]

    Here, we generate and solve the cubic equations of the AES SBox (see :issue:`26676`)::

        sage: # long time
        sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_sequence import PolynomialSequence
        sage: from sage.sat.boolean_polynomials import solve as solve_sat
        sage: sr = sage.crypto.mq.SR(1, 4, 4, 8,
        ....:                        allow_zero_inversions=True)
        sage: sb = sr.sbox()
        sage: eqs = sb.polynomials(degree=3)
        sage: eqs = PolynomialSequence(eqs)
        sage: variables = map(str, eqs.variables())
        sage: variables = ",".join(variables)
        sage: R = BooleanPolynomialRing(16, variables)
        sage: eqs = [R(eq) for eq in eqs]
        sage: sls_aes = solve_sat(eqs, n=infinity)
        sage: len(sls_aes)
        256

    TESTS:

    Test that :issue:`26676` is fixed::

        sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(names=varl)
        sage: B.inject_variables(verbose=False)

    .. NOTE::

        Although supported, passing converter and solver objects
