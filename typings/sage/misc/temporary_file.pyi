    .. warning::

        If you need a particular file extension always use
        ``tmp_filename(ext=\'.foo\')``, this will ensure that the file
        does not yet exist. If you were to use

    - ``ext`` -- (default: ``\'\'``) a suffix for the file name. If you
      want a filename extension in the usual sense, this should start
      with a dot.

class atomic_write:
    '''
    Write to a given file using a temporary file and then rename it
    to the target file. This renaming should be atomic on modern
    operating systems. Therefore, this class can be used to avoid race
    conditions when a file might be read while it is being written.
    It also avoids having partially written files due to exceptions
    or crashes.

    This is to be used in a ``with`` statement, where a temporary file
    is created when entering the ``with`` and is moved in place of the
    target file when exiting the ``with`` (if no exceptions occurred).

    INPUT:

    - ``target_filename`` -- the name of the file to be written
      Normally, the contents of this file will be overwritten

    - ``append`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True`` and
      ``target_filename`` is an existing file, then copy the current
      contents of ``target_filename`` to the temporary file when
      entering the ``with`` statement. Otherwise, the temporary file is
      initially empty.

    - ``mode`` -- (default: ``0o666``) mode bits for the file. The
      temporary file is created with mode ``mode & ~umask`` and the
      resulting file will also have these permissions (unless the
      mode bits of the file were changed manually). (Not to be confused with
      the file opening mode.)

    - ``binary`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);
      the underlying file is opened in binary mode.  If ``False`` then it is
      opened in text mode and an encoding with which to write the file may be
      supplied.

    - ``**kwargs`` -- additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying
      `io.open` call

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from sage.misc.temporary_file import atomic_write
        sage: target_file = tmp_filename()
        sage: with open(target_file, \'w\') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("Old contents")
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("New contents")
        ....:     f.flush()
        ....:     with open(target_file, \'r\') as f2:
        ....:         f2.read()
        \'Old contents\'
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'New contents\'

    The name of the temporary file can be accessed using ``f.name``.
    It is not a problem to close and re-open the temporary file::

        sage: from sage.misc.temporary_file import atomic_write
        sage: target_file = tmp_filename()
        sage: with open(target_file, \'w\') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("Old contents")
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file) as f:
        ....:     f.close()
        ....:     with open(f.name, \'w\') as f2:
        ....:         _ = f2.write("Newer contents")
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'Newer contents\'

    If an exception occurs while writing the file, the target file is
    not touched::

        sage: with atomic_write(target_file) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("Newest contents")
        ....:     raise RuntimeError
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        RuntimeError
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'Newer contents\'

    Some examples of using the ``append`` option. Note that the file
    is never opened in "append" mode, it is possible to overwrite
    existing data::

        sage: target_file = tmp_filename()
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, append=True) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("Hello")
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, append=True) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write(" World")
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'Hello World\'
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, append=True) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.seek(0)
        ....:     _ = f.write("HELLO")
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'HELLO World\'

    If the target file is a symbolic link, the link is kept and the
    target of the link is written to::

        sage: link_to_target = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), "templink")
        sage: os.symlink(target_file, link_to_target)
        sage: with atomic_write(link_to_target) as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("Newest contents")
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'Newest contents\'

    We check the permission bits of the new file. Note that the old
    permissions do not matter::

        sage: os.chmod(target_file, 0o600)
        sage: _ = os.umask(0o022)
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file) as f:
        ....:     pass
        sage: \'{:#o}\'.format(os.stat(target_file).st_mode & 0o777)
        \'0o644\'
        sage: _ = os.umask(0o077)
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, mode=0o777) as f:
        ....:     pass
        sage: \'{:#o}\'.format(os.stat(target_file).st_mode & 0o777)
        \'0o700\'

    Test writing twice to the same target file. The outermost ``with``
    "wins"::

        sage: with open(target_file, \'w\') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write(\'>>> \')
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, append=True) as f,         ....:          atomic_write(target_file, append=True) as g:
        ....:     _ = f.write("AAA"); f.close()
        ....:     _ = g.write("BBB"); g.close()
        sage: with open(target_file, \'r\') as f:
        ....:     f.read()
        \'>>> AAA\'

    Supplying an encoding means we\'re writing the file in "text mode" (in the
    same sense as `io.open`) and so we must write unicode strings::

        sage: target_file = tmp_filename()
        sage: with atomic_write(target_file, binary=False,
        ....:                   encoding=\'utf-8\') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write(u\'Hélas\')
        sage: import io
        sage: with io.open(target_file, encoding=\'utf-8\') as f:
        ....:     print(f.read())
        Hélas

    Supplying an encoding in binary mode (or other arguments that don\'t
    make sense to `io.open` in binary mode) is an error::

        sage: writer = atomic_write(target_file, binary=True,
        ....:                       encoding=\'utf-8\')
        sage: with writer as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write(u\'Hello\')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: binary mode doesn\'t take an encoding argument
